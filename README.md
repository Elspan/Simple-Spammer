# Simple-Spammer
This is a simple spammer for Discord, Games and more!

How to use it:

First type the text that you want to spam in the text box, then press the "START" button.
Once you pressed the "START" button, click on the text box that you want to spam, for example the Discord message box.
Be careful some applications may block you if you spam too fast, so you can use cursor to lower the speed (by default it is set to 1ms, but you can go as low as 1000ms).
If you want to stop spamming, press the "STOP" button.
The "TOP MOST" check box, controls if the application is top of other applications on your computer.
The "CLEAR" button, clears out all the text in the textbox.
